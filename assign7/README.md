a.
In my program, I represented zero polynomial as constant 0.
For example, f(x) = 0 + 0*x + 0*x^2 is 0

b.
The program allows users to type the degree and coefficient like above, f(x) = 0 + 0*x + 0*x^2
But after that, it checks the largest degree which is x^2 in this case, and if it's zero,
degree would be decremented.
And keep doing until the highest degree is not zero of degree is 0
When output, if degree is zero and the coefficient is also zero, print as 0

c.
No

I did BONUS part
